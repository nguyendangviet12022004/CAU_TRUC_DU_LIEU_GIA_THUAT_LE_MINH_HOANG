1) Main diagonal : i increase and j also increase => i - j is const
2) Second diagonal: i increase and j decrease => i + j is const


pseudo code
backtrack(i)
	for j in [1..n]
		if all (col[j], mainDiagonal[i-j], secondDiagonal[i+j]) are false
			config[i] := j
			if i = n
				accept the config
			else
				col[j] = mainDiagonal[i-j] = secondDiagonal[i+j] := True
				backtrack(i+1)
				col[j] = mainDiagonal[i-j] = secondDiagonal[i+j] := False
